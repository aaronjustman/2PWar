Bugs: NONE!

Current:
- Keep stats; display at the end of match

Stats:
	- Time of match *DONE*
	- Total cards won *DONE*
	-- PREMIUM STATS:
		- Total hands won *DONE*
		- Total hands lost *DONE*
		- Wars won *DONE*
		- Wars lost *DONE*
		- Overall record (total individualized stats)
		- number of 2x, 3x, 4x wars, etc. (store by dictionary of [Int:Int] where [multiplier:number]
		- Individualized player stats (wins/losses, win/lose vs. any other players)

To do (?):
- Refactor stats into a struct (*DONE*) and implement a game manager (using user defaults) for tracking players and all-time stats, also will need a player refactor.
- Start screen, to choose 1-player or 2-player, and to enter names.
- Add cards to the war cards stack instead of overwriting on multiple wars.
