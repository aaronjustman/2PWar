Bugs:
- Table not being cleared on new game or game reset (war cards stacks, plus cards labels).
- Make sure total cards won is still being tallied correctly.
- Change text on OptionsVC to black.
- Change Cancel button to 'OK!'
- Set constraints for the OptionsVC.

Current:


Stats:
	-- PREMIUM STATS:
		- Overall record (total individualized stats)
		- number of 2x, 3x, 4x wars, etc. (store by dictionary of [Int:Int] where [multiplier:number]
		- Individualized player stats (wins/losses, win/lose vs. any other players)

To do (?):
- Implement a game manager (using user defaults) for tracking players and all-time stats, also will need a player refactor.
- Start screen, to choose 1-player or 2-player, and to enter names.
